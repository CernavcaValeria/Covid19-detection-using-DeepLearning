# Covid19-detection-using-DeepLearning
Implement a Neural Network using transfer learning technique and CNN pre-trained models: VGG16 / 19, InceptionV3, Xception, Densnet.
 Performing a series of experiments on CNN, using a data set of over 3000 units.
Performance analysis of the trained models and their use in the X-Ray image classification, in order to detect the Covid19 infection.
